Code designed to test capabilites of Maple Native board,
and it's ability to function as a high-density, low-
speed acquisition device.

***** timerTest.cpp *****
Four timers, TIMER1-4, produce 50% duty cycle waves at 
frequencies of 32kHz, 16kHz, 8kHz, and 4kHz. The PWM
waves are configured using bit registers so no 
processor cycles are spent maintaining the waves. 

*****  adcTest.cpp  *****
ADC1 is configured to sample pin X when triggered from
TIMER1 CC1 event. TIMER1 is set to oscillate at 32 kHz,
and the onboard LED is toggled after 32000 ADC samples.
Thus, the board LED should toggle at a rate of 1 Hz. 
Again, all code is based on built-in pheripherals, so
no processor cycles are spent maintaining ADC sampling
(function in loop is only serving as validtaion, and is
not critical to ADC operation).

TODO:
spiTest.cpp   -- need FT4232H
dmaTest.cpp   -- need spiTest to verify data transfer
